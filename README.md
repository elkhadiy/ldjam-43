> Sacrifies must be made

Something went horribly wrong with your crewâ€™s spaceship.

Now you need to survive by allocating crew members to resource production facilities.

Some facilities need specific resources to produce other resources.

Crew consumes resources to survive.

Should the less productive of the lot be allowed to chew on your precious resources?
